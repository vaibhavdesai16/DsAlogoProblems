Problem smatement:

Find the maximum number of consecutive integers that can be formed in a given array of non repeating integers having continuous indexes.

Example 1:

input - { 9, 21, 23, 22, 35, 48, 49 }

output - 3

21, 23, 22 can form 21, 22, 23 and have continuous index 1, 2, 3



Example 2:

input - { 15, 18, 21, 51, 52, 55, 53, 56, 54, 91, 95, 100 }

output - 6

51, 52, 55, 53, 56, 54  can form 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56  and have continuous index 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
